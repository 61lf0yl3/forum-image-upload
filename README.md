# forum-image-upload
In forum image upload, registered users have the possibility to create a post containing an image as well as text.      When viewing the post, users and guests should see the image associated to it.  There are various extensions for images like: JPEG, SVG, PNG, GIF, etc. In this project you have to handle at least JPEG, PNG and GIF types.  The max size of the images to load should be 20 mb. If there is an attempt to load an image greater than 20mb, an error message should inform the user that the image is too big.
